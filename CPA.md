# Unit 1

## Introduction
#### Supercomputing
+ Concurrent execution of different tasks by different processing units
+ Concurrency can happen: 
  + in a single processor (several cores sharing key units)
  + in a single computer (with diff. processors)
    + with shared memory (all processors have same access)
    + with distributed memory (processor assigned to a memory) (info. exchanged with messages)
  + in a local network
  + in the Internet (fua, la ingenier√≠a)

## Parallel computing models
##### 	Flynn's Taxonomy

| Instruction \ Data       | Single Data                | Multiple Data                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Single Instruction**   | SISD - Sequential computer | SIMD - Vector computers                  |
| **Multiple Instruction** | MISD                       | MIMD - Multiprocessors, Multi-core, clusters |
