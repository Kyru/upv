# Unit 1

### Introduction
##### Parallel computing applications

##### Supercomputing
+ Concurrent execution of different tasks by different processing units
+ Concurrency can happen: 
	+ in a single processor (several cores sharing key units)
	+ in a single computer (with diff. processors)
		+ with shared memory (all processors have same access)
		+ with distributed memory (processor assigned to a memory) (info. exchanged with messages)
	+ in a local network
	+ in the Internet (fua, la ingenier√≠a)
